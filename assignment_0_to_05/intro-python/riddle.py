# This program calculates the ages of five friends based on given conditions.

# Defining ages based on the riddle conditions
anton_age = 21  # Anton is 21 years old
beth_age = anton_age + 6  # Beth is 6 years older than Anton
chen_age = beth_age + 20  # Chen is 20 years older than Beth
drew_age = chen_age + anton_age  # Drew is as old as Chen's age plus Anton's age
ethan_age = chen_age  # Ethan is the same age as Chen

# Printing names and ages
print(f"Anton is {anton_age}")
print(f"Beth is {beth_age}")
print(f"Chen is {chen_age}")
print(f"Drew is {drew_age}")
