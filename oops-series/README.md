# OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Assignment

This repository contains an assignment that covers various concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. The objective is to help learners understand and implement essential OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment includes 21 problems related to different OOP concepts. Each problem demonstrates practical usage of OOP features and their application in solving real-world problems. You are required to implement classes, methods, constructors, decorators, inheritance, etc., as per the problem statements.

## List of Questions

1. **Using self**  
   - Create a class `Student` with attributes `name` and `marks`. Use the `self` keyword to initialize these values via a constructor. Add a method `display()` that prints student details.

2. **Using cls**  
   - Create a class `Counter` that keeps track of how many objects have been created. Use a class variable and a class method with `cls` to manage and display the count.

3. **Public Variables and Methods**  
   - Create a class `Car` with a public variable `brand` and a public method `start()`. Instantiate the class and access both from outside the class.

4. **Class Variables and Class Methods**  
   - Create a class `Bank` with a class variable `bank_name`. Add a class method `change_bank_name(cls, name)` that allows changing the bank name. Show that it affects all instances.

5. **Static Variables and Static Methods**  
   - Create a class `MathUtils` with a static method `add(a, b)` that returns the sum. No class or instance variables should be used.

6. **Constructors and Destructors**  
   - Create a class `Logger` that prints a message when an object is created (constructor) and another message when it is destroyed (destructor).

7. **Access Modifiers: Public, Private, and Protected**  
   - Create a class `Employee` with:
     - A public variable `name`,
     - A protected variable `_salary`, and
     - A private variable `__ssn`.
   - Try accessing all three variables from an object of the class and document what happens.

8. **super() Function**  
   - Create a class `Person` with a constructor that sets the name. Inherit a class `Teacher` from it, add a `subject` field, and use `super()` to call the base class constructor.

9. **Abstract Classes and Methods**  
   - Use the `abc` module to create an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `area()`. Inherit a class `Rectangle` that implements `area()`.

10. **Instance Methods**  
    - Create a class `Dog` with instance variables `name` and `breed`. Add an instance method `bark()` that prints a message including the dog's name.

11. **Class Methods**  
    - Create a class `Book` with a class variable `total_books`. Add a class method `increment_book_count()` to increase the count when a new book is added.

12. **Static Methods**  
    - Create a class `TemperatureConverter` with a static method `celsius_to_fahrenheit(c)` that returns the Fahrenheit value.

13. **Composition**  
    - Create a class `Engine` and a class `Car`. Use composition by passing an `Engine` object to the `Car` class during initialization. Access a method of the `Engine` class via the `Car` class.

14. **Aggregation**  
    - Create a class `Department` and a class `Employee`. Use aggregation by having a `Department` object store a reference to an `Employee` object that exists independently of it.

15. **Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance**  
    - Create four classes:
      - `A` with a method `show()`,
      - `B` and `C` that inherit from `A` and override `show()`,
      - `D` that inherits from both `B` and `C`.
    - Create an object of `D` and call `show()` to observe MRO.

16. **Function Decorators**  
    - Write a decorator function `log_function_call` that prints "Function is being called" before a function executes. Apply it to a function `say_hello()`.

17. **Class Decorators**  
    - Create a class decorator `add_greeting` that modifies a class to add a `greet()` method returning "Hello from Decorator!". Apply it to a class `Person`.

18. **Property Decorators: @property, @setter, and @deleter**  
    - Create a class `Product` with a private attribute `_price`. Use `@property` to get the price, `@price.setter` to update it, and `@price.deleter` to delete it.

19. **callable() and __call__()**  
    - Create a class `Multiplier` with an `__init__()` to set a factor. Define a `__call__()` method that multiplies an input by the factor. Test it with `callable()` and by calling the object like a function.

20. **Creating a Custom Exception**  
    - Create a custom exception `InvalidAgeError`. Write a function `check_age(age)` that raises this exception if age < 18. Handle it with `try...except`.

21. **Make a Custom Class Iterable**  
    - Create a class `Countdown` that takes a start number. Implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()` to make the object iterable in a for-loop, counting down to 0.
